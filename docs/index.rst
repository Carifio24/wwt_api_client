wwt_api_client: Pythonic access to the WorldWide Telescope web services
=======================================================================

The AAS `WorldWide Telescope <http://worldwidetelescope.org/home>`_ is a free
and powerful visualization engine developed by the `American Astronomical
Society <https://aas.org/>`_ that can display astronomical and planetary data.
This engine is powered by a large (multi-terabyte) collection of astronomical
survey data stored in the cloud. The ``wwt_api_client`` package allows you to
invoke the web APIs that constitute the WWT backend API.
